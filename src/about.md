I currently live in London. Iâ€™ve lived in Alabama, Mississippi, the District of Columbia, Michigan, Poland, Belgium, and the Netherlands.

I work for a university, on a team that makes [free publishing software](/blog/my-niche-industry.html). I also teach a night class on web development.

Most of my recent work is in Python, but I also care a lot about how things are done in HTML, CSS, and, you know, English and other human languages.
