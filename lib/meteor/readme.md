# Meteor

A theme for the Ark static site generator that has these goals:

- accessibility
- blog support
- user-determined light and dark mode
- built-in support for Tabler icons
- Jinja2 templating, including on source files before conversion to HTML
- collocation of component HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (in the future)

For a lot of the CSS, Iâ€™ve drawn from my work on early iterations of
[Memory Alpha](https://github.com/openlibhums/memory-alpha).
